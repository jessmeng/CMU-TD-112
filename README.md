# CMU Tower Defense 112
# Overview
CMU Tower Defense (TD) 112 is a Carnegie Mellon version of the popular game: Bloons Tower Defense (TD) 5. This game is designed as a typical tower defense game with Scottie Dogs as towers and various universities as the Bloons. The goal of the game is to prevent Bloons from successfully getting through the map. This is done by strategically placing Scottie Dogs to shoot and pop the Bloons. There are five different levels of Bloons, with each level popping to its previous level. Every time a Bloon goes through the map, the user loses a life (or lives depending on the level of the Bloon). There are a total of twenty levels in this game. 

# Installation
In order to run this project, you will need to be able to run Python code on your computer or device. This can be done via calling the Python interpreter with a "shebang" line or via an interactive Python Shell. While this project was being created and tested, pyzo (a Python IDE) was used, with all this code being run in a Python shell. 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science, a computer science class taught at Carnegie Mellon University, provides easy-to-follow instructions on their course website for installing Python and pyzo: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/notes-getting-started.html (Note: I did not write this; this is courtesy of the 15-112 Class Notes). Python Central also provides instructions on how to run Python files: https://www.pythoncentral.io/execute-python-script-file-shell/ (Note: I also did not write this; this is courtesy of Python Central). The main resource used for this project is pygame, which is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It can be downloaded through the pygame website: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml. There are several .py files, since each .py file is a different element or aspect for the general project. The entire project put together is the "main.py" file, which is for the entire user experience. There is also an "assets" folder that you will need in order access all the images, music, and levels that are a part of the game. These files are .pdf, .wav, .mp3, and .txt files.
